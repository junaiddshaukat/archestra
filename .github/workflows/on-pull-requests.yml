concurrency:
  # Cancel any running workflow for the same branch when new commits are pushed.
  # We group both by ref_name (available when CI is triggered by a push to a branch/tag)
  # and head_ref (available when CI is triggered by a PR).
  # For merge queue, we use merge_group to ensure each merge queue run gets its own group.
